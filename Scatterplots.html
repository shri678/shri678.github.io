<p>I'm curious to know about a country's well being. The 2 variables I chose to understand it were: 
<ul>
  <li>Human Development Index (HDI), a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators. The top “ranked” 66 countries are considered to have a high HDI. 
  <li>Employment rate. A country has full employment if that country has an unemployment rate of 5% or less. 
</ul>
</p>
