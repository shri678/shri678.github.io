<p class = "sentence">I received this data from UNICEF regarding infant mortality rates containing data for most countries from years 2009 to 2015. I selected the year as my x-axis and mortality  I selected Haiti in particular and did an average of all countries, to compare where Haiti stood with the rest of the world. I made the conclusion that Haiti’s infant mortality rates were significantly higher than that of the world’s average.  </p>
