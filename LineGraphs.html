<p class = "sentence">I downloaded data from <a href = "https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets/#">UNICEF</a> regarding infant mortality rates for most countries from years 2009 to 2015. I selected the year as my x-axis and mortality as my y-axis. I compared Haiti with the rest of the world. I made the conclusion that Haiti’s infant mortality rates were significantly higher than that of the world’s average.</p>
