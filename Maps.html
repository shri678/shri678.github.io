<p class = "sentence"> This map points to different countries in the world and the purple dot labels both the <i>Electricity Per Person</i> and <i>Total Electricity</i> 500k people of each country. The size of the dot represents the value for the electricity per person.</p>

<p class = "sentence">To make this map, I made up the statistic <i>Electricity Need vs Generated</i>, which is equal to the <i>Total Electricity</i> of the country divided by <i>Electricity needed</i> of the country. The map labels the country, Electricity Per Person, and Total Electricity. This time, all the dots for all countries are the same size. If the <i>Electricity Needed</i> of a country exceeds it's <i>Electricity Total</i>, the color of the dot corresponding to the country will be blue. Else, the color is purple.</p>


<iframe width="900" height="800" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="/maps/map3.html"></iframe>
<p class = "sentence"> The map shows the color of the value of <i>Electricity Need vs Generated</i>. The more blue the country is, the greater the value. The lighter the color, the lesser the value.
