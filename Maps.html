<p class = "sentence"> This map points to different countries in the world and the purple dot labels both the <i>Electricity Per Person</i> and <i>Total Electricity</i> 500k people of each country. The size of the dot represents the value for the electricity per person.</p>

<p class = "sentence">The map labels the country, Electricity Per Person, and Total Electricity. This time, all the dots for all countries are the same. If the <i>Electricity Needed</i> of a country exceeds it's <i>Electricity Total</i>, the color of the dot corresponding to the country will be blue.   </p>

<p class = "sentence"> The statistic <i>Electricity Need vs Generated</i> is equal to the <i>Total Electricity</i> of the country divided by <i>Electricity needed</i> of the country. If the value for the Electricity Need vs Generated is 1, then the country is meeting it's needs. If it is less than 1, they are not meeting their needs and vice versa.</p>
