<!--Final Proj -->

<p> For those who don't know cricket, it can be thought of as a 360° version of baseball but with many twists.
     Cricket is a team sport for two teams of eleven players each. 
Teams bat in successive innings and attempt to score runs, while the opposing team fields and attempts to bring an end to the batting team's innings. After each team has batted an equal number of innings (depending on the format of the game), the team with the most runs wins.


     
     <br>
     <br>
     
     As stated, there are different formats of the game. Some examples include, but not limited to, are: 
     <ul>
          <li>20 overs ≈ 3 hours
          <li>50 overs ≈ 7 hours
          <li>test matches, which last for ≈2-5 days. People play during the day so they do get sleep :)
     </ul>

<p> For my final project, I created 8 visualizations for Cricket. 4 for IPL, and 4 for ODI's. Regarding ODI, I analyze the top batsman and the top bowlers best performance vs their current performance.<br> Regarding IPL teams, I analyze the teams within the competition.</p>
