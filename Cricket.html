<!--Final Proj -->

<p> For those who don't know cricket, it can be thought of as a 360° version of baseball but with a twist. There are 
     <ul>
          <li>Batters
          <li>bowlers, and 
          <li>fielders.  
     </ul>

</p>

<p> For my final project, I created 8 visualizations for Cricket. 4 for IPL, and 4 for ODI's. I will explain what they mean later in the link to my final project below.</p>
