<p> For those who don't know cricket, it can be thought of as a 360° version of baseball but with many twists.
     Cricket is a team sport for two teams of eleven players each. 
Teams bat in successive innings and attempt to score runs, while the opposing team fields and attempts to bring an end to the batting team's innings. After each team has batted an equal number of innings (depending on the format of the game), the team with the most runs wins.

     As stated, there are different formats of the game. Some examples include, but not limited to, are: 
     <ul>
          <li>20 overs ≈ 3 hours
          <li>50 overs ≈ 7 hours
          <li>test matches, which lasts for ≈2-5 days.
     </ul>

<p>I created 8 visualizations for Cricket. 3 for Indian Premier League (<a href = "https://www.iplt20.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IPL</a>), and 4 for One Day Internationals (ODI's). Regarding ODI, I analyzed the top batsman and the top bowler's best performance vs their current performance.<br> For IPL, I analyzed the performance of various teams within the competition.</p>
